# Eat-N-Split

## Description

This project allows a user to add friends and avatar images. The user can then select a friend and split a bill based off of a total amount, amount the user pays, and the amount a friend pays. The left over remainder will be added or subtracted from what the user owes or friend owes based on the remaining value.
